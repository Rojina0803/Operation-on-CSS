    <p>Cute is a word whose meaning has gone has gone through a thorough historical transformation. 
        There is no argument about cute’s derivation: it is a shortening of acute (and was sometimes actually spelled ‘cute). 
        Acute has meant “clever, shrewd” since Shakespeare’s time and has had a set of other meanings as well, but it has never been defined as “attractive or pretty.” 
        The contraction cute first appears in the early 18th century, but only a century later does it begin to take on its distinctive modern meaning; even after 1900 children were still being called cute as a compliment to their intelligence. 
        (Compare the contemporaneous word cunning, with its strikingly similar ambiguity.) A few years into the century,
         we start to see the word—finally!—in descriptions of puppies and kittens. But the original sense hasn’t completely vanished; in such sentences as “Don’t get cute with me,” cute has nothing to do with adorable sweetness.Cute is a word whose meaning has gone has gone through a thorough historical transformation.
